# Introduction

This document gives an introduction to and overview of inferring the **clone**
identity of cells using the `r Biocpkg("cardelino")` package using a given 
clonal structure.

`r Biocpkg("cardelino")` can use variant information extracted from single-cell 
RNA-seq reads to probabilistically assign single-cell transcriptomes to 
individual clones.

Briefly, `r Biocpkg("cardelino")` is based on a Bayesian mixture model with a 
beta-binomial error model to account for sequencing errors as well as a 
gene-specific model for allelic imbalance between haplotypes and associated bias
in variant detection. Bayesian inference allows the model to account for 
uncertainty in model parameters and cell assignments.

We assume that clones are tagged by somatic mutations, and that these mutations
are known (e.g. from exome sequencing or equivalent). Given a set of known 
mutations, these sites can be interrogated in scRNA-seq reads to obtain evidence 
for the presence or absence of each mutation in each cell. As input, the model 
requires the count of reads supporting the alternative (mutant) allele at each 
mutation site, the total number of reads overlapping the mutation site 
("coverage"). 

Typically, coverage of somatic mutations in scRNA-seq data is very
sparse (most mutation sites in a given cell have no read coverage), but the 
`r Biocpkg("cardelino")` model accounts for this sparsity and aggregates 
information across all available mutation sites to infer clonal identity.


# Clone ID with a clonal tree provided

In many clone ID scenarios, a clonal tree is known. That is, we have been able 
to infer the clones present in the sampled cell population, for example using 
bulk or single-cell DNA-seq data, and we know which mutations are expected to be
present in which clones.

To infer the clonal identity of cells when a clonal tree is provided, 
`r Biocpkg("cardelino")` requires the following input data:

* A: a variant x cell matrix of integer counts, providing the number of reads
supporting the alternative allele for each variant in each cell;
* D: a variant x cell matrix of integer counts, providing the total number of 
reads overlapping each variant in each cell;
* Config: a variant x clone "configuration" matrix of binary values providing 
the clone-variant configuration by indicating which mutations are expected to be 
present in which clones.

The configuration matrix, Config, can be provided by other tools used to infer 
the clonal structure of the cell population. For example, the package 
`r CRANpkg("Canopy")` can be used to infer a clonal tree from DNA-seq data and 
the "Z" element of its output is the configuration matrix.

Here, we demonstrate the use of `r Biocpkg("cardelino")` to assign 77 cells to 
clones identified with `r CRANpkg("Canopy")` using 112 somatic mutations. 

We load the package and the example clone ID dataset distributed with the 
package in VCF ([variant call format](https://github.com/samtools/hts-specs)) 
format, which is mostly used for storing genotype data. Here, the 
`cellSNP.cells.vcf.gz` is computed by using
[cellsnp-lite](https://cellsnp-lite.readthedocs.io) on a list pre-identified 
somatic variants from bulk WES.

```{r load-pkg}
library(ggplot2)
library(cardelino)
```

There are many possible ways to extract the data required by `cardelino` from a 
VCF file, here we show just one approach using convenience functions in 
`cardelino`:

```{r read-vcf-data}
vcf_file <- system.file("extdata", "cellSNP.cells.vcf.gz", package = "cardelino")
input_data <- load_cellSNP_vcf(vcf_file)
```

Alternatively you can load the `A` and `D` matrices yourself and combine them
into a list, for example `input_data = list('A' = A, 'D' = D)`. 

We can visualize the allele frequency of the mutation allele. As expected, the
majority of entries are missing (in grey) due to the high sparsity in scRNA-seq 
data. For the same reason, even for the non-missing entries, the estimate of 
allele frequency is of high uncertainty. For this reason, it is crucial to 
probabilistic clustering with accounting the uncertainty, ideally with guide 
clonal tree structure from external data. 

```{r allele-frequency, , fig.height = 3, fig.width = 5}
AF <- as.matrix(input_data$A / input_data$D)

p = pheatmap::pheatmap(AF, cluster_rows=FALSE, cluster_cols=FALSE,
                   show_rownames = TRUE, show_colnames = TRUE,
                   labels_row='77 cells', labels_col='112 SNVs',
                   angle_col=0, angle_row=0)
```


Next, we will load the Canopy tree results for the same individual.
The clonal tree inferred by Canopy for this donor consists of three clones, 
including a "base" clone ("clone1") that has no sublconal somatic mutations 
present.


```{r read-canopy-data}
canopy_res <- readRDS(system.file("extdata", "canopy_results.coveraged.rds", 
                                  package = "cardelino"))
Config <- canopy_res$tree$Z
```

Be careful to ensure that the same variant IDs are used in both data sources.

```{r correct-variant-ids}
rownames(Config) <- gsub(":", "_", rownames(Config))
```

We can visualize the clonal tree structure obtained from `Canopy`:

```{r plot-tre}
plot_tree(canopy_res$tree, orient = "v")
```

The included dataset contains the A and D matrices, so combined with the Canopy 
tree object provided, we have the necessary input to probabilistically assign 
cells to clones. Note, `min_iter = 800, max_iter = 1200` is used only for 
quick illustration. Please remove them for the default values or set higher 
number of iterations to ensure convergence of the Gibbs sampling.

```{r cell-assign}
set.seed(7)
assignments <- clone_id(input_data$A, input_data$D, Config = Config,
                        min_iter = 800, max_iter = 1200)
names(assignments)
```

We can visualise the cell-clone assignment probabilities as a heatmap.

```{r prob-heatmap}
prob_heatmap(assignments$prob)
```

We recommend assigning a cell to the highest-probability clone if the highest 
posterior probability is greater than 0.5 and leaving cells "unassigned" if they
do not reach this threshold. The `assign_cells_to_clones` function conveniently
assigns cells to clones based on a threshold and returns a data.frame with the
cell-clone assignments.

```{r assign-cell-clone-easy}
df <- assign_cells_to_clones(assignments$prob)
head(df)
table(df$clone)
```


Also, Cardelino will update the guide clonal tree Config matrix (as a prior)
and return a posterior estimate. In the figure below, negative value means the
probability of a certain variant presents in a certain clone is reduced in 
posterior compared to prior (i.e., the input Config). Vice verse for the 
positive values.
```{r Config update}
heat_matrix(t(assignments$Config_prob - Config)) + 
  scale_fill_gradient2() +
  ggtitle('Changes of clonal Config') + 
  labs(x='Clones', y='112 SNVs') +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_blank(), legend.position = "right")
```


Finally, we can visualize the results cell assignment and updated mutations 
clonal configuration at the raw allele frequency matrix:

```{r results-plot, fig.height = 4.5, fig.width = 7.5}
AF <- as.matrix(input_data$A / input_data$D)
cardelino::vc_heatmap(AF, assignments$prob, Config, show_legend=TRUE)
```


# Clone ID without input clonal tree
As shown above, the Config can be updated by the observations from scRNA-seq 
data. A step further is to not including the Config entirely. This can be 
possible, as there could be no clonal tree available. In this case, you can use 
cardelino in its de-novo by set `Config=NULL` and set a number for `n_clones`. 
Note, by default we will keep the first clone as base clone, i.e., no mutations.
You can turn it off by set `keep_base_clone=FALSE`.

```{denovo-cell-assign}
assignments <- clone_id(input_data$A, input_data$D, Config=NULL, n_clone = 3)
```

## Clone ID on mitochondrial variations
As an further illustration, we will show how cardelino can be used to infer the
clonal structure from mitochondrial vairations, that called from 
[MQuad](https://github.com/single-cell-genetics/MQuad). Again, we have included
the MQuad output in `.mtx` format in the cardelino package. Note, this 
mitochondrial data is from the same SMART-seq data set above.

First, let's import these two AD and DP matrices and together with their 
variant names.

```{r read in mtx files}
AD_file <- system.file("extdata", "passed_ad.mtx", package = "cardelino")
DP_file <- system.file("extdata", "passed_dp.mtx", package = "cardelino")
id_file <- system.file("extdata", "passed_variant_names.txt", package = "cardelino")

AD <- Matrix::readMM(AD_file)
DP <- Matrix::readMM(DP_file)
var_ids <- read.table(id_file, )
rownames(AD) <- rownames(DP) <- var_ids[, 1]
colnames(AD) <- colnames(DP) <- paste0('Cell', seq(ncol(DP)))
```

Same as above, AD and DP are matrices with variants as rows and cells as column.
In this case we have 25 variants (rows) and 77 cells (columns). As expected, 
the coverage of mtDNA is a lot higher than the nuclear genome above (much fewer
missing values).

```{r pheatmap, fig.height = 4.5, fig.width = 8.5}
AF_mt <- as.matrix(AD / DP)
pheatmap::pheatmap(AF_mt)
```
Now, we can run cardelino on the mitochondrial variations. Note, as there is 
no prior clonal tree, the model is easier to return a local optima. Generally,
we recommend running it multiple time (with different random seed or 
initializations) and pick the one with highest DIC.

```{r denovo-mtDNA}
set.seed(7)
assign_mtClones <- clone_id(AD, DP, Config=NULL, n_clone = 3, keep_base_clone=FALSE)
```

Then visualise allele frequency along with the clustering of cells and variants:
```{r vc_heatmap-mtDNA, fig.height = 4.2, fig.width = 7}
Config_mt <- assign_mtClones$Config_prob
Config_mt[Config_mt >= 0.5] = 1
Config_mt[Config_mt <  0.5] = 0
cardelino::vc_heatmap(AF_mt, assign_mtClones$prob, Config_mt, show_legend=TRUE)
```


# Session information {.unnumbered}

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
