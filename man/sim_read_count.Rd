\usage{
sim_read_count(C, D, Psi = NULL, means = c(0.03, 0.55), vars = c(1, 10),
  cell_num = 300, permute_D = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{C}{A matrix of binary values. The clone-variant configuration, whcih 
encodes the phylogenetic tree structure, and the genotype of each clone.}

\item{D}{A matrix of integers. Sequencing depth for N variants across x 
cells (ideally >100 cells). NA means 0 here.}

\item{Psi}{A vector of float. The fractions of each clone. If NULL, set a 
uniform distribution.}

\item{means}{A vector of two floats. The mean theta_1 (false positive rate) 
and the mean theta_2 (true positive rate).}

\item{vars}{A vector of two floats. The variance of theta_1 and theta_2.}

\item{cell_num}{A interger. The number of cells to generate.}

\item{permute_D}{A boolean value. If True permute variants in D.}
}
\value{
a list containing \code{A_sim}, a matrix for alteration reads, 
\code{A_sim}, a matrix for total reads, \code{I_sim}, a matrix for clonal 
label, \code{H_sim}, a matrix for genotype, \code{theta1}, a matrix of 
expected false positive rate, and \code{theta2}, a matrix of expected true 
positive rate.

\description{
There are following steps to generate the simulated reads counts for variants
in single cells:
1) given the clonal genotype and the clonal prevalence, the genotypes (i.e, 
the clone) of cells will be generated following a multinormial distribution. 
2) given the distribution of reads coverage, e.g., a matrix of read coverage 
from real data, (variant specific), the total reads of each variant will be 
generated by random sampling. Note, the missing rate is gorvened by this 
matrix.
3) the allelic frequence of each variant will be generated by following a 
beta distribution with paramters of mean and varince.
4) Given the genotype of a cell, if the mutation exists in a cell, the 
alteration read counts will be generated by a binomial distribution, 
papramitized the allelic frequency, sampled from step 3.
5) Given the genotype of a cell, if the mutation does not exist in a cell, 
the alteration read counts will be genenrated by a binomial distribution,
paramerized by the technical error rate.
